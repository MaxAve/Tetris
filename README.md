# Tetris
A basic tetris game written in awful code
## IMPORTANT!
This project is currently in the "Indev" stage (In-development) a lot of critical features are NOT IMPLEMENTED as of yet, fell free to contribute to the project,
or you can wait until I gather the bravery to go into the dark forest of my awful code.
#### What is (not) implemented?
Currently, the two things that HAVE NOT been implemented are a GUI, and a way to win the game. These features should be added soon.
#### What is planned?
1. A way to win the game
2. Flipped variations of some of the brick models
3. Various bug fixes and imporvements
## How to play
The objective of the game is to place all the falling bricks in such a way that they form a filled structure with no holes (this is not yet implemented)
When the bricks fill up a straight line without any holes, this line will dissappear and you will recieve points (also not yet implemented)
#### Controls
This game follows the classic rules of Tetris:\
```Left/Right arrow keys``` - Move brick from side to side\
```Down arrow key``` - rotate brick clockwise (anti-clockwise rotation should be added later)
